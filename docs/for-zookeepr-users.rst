Things that are the same
------------------------
* You have an inventory of products
* Complete registrations are made up of multiple products
* Products are split into categories
* Products can be listed under ceilings
* Products can be included for free by purchasing other items
  * e.g. a Professional Ticket includes a dinner ticket
* Products can be enabled by user roles
  * e.g. Speakers Dinner tickets are visible to speakers
* Vouchers can be used to discount products

Things that are different
-------------------------
* Ceilings can be used to apply discounts, so Early Bird ticket rates can be
  implemented by applying a ceiling-type discount, rather than duplicating the
  ticket type.
* Vouchers can be used to enable products
  * e.g. Sponsor tickets do not appear until you supply a sponsor's voucher
* Items may be enabled by having other specific items present
  * e.g. Extra accommodation nights do not appear until you purchase the main
  week worth of accommodation.
