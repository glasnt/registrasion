Registrasion
============

Registrasion is a conference registration package that goes well with the Symposion suite of conference management apps for Django. It's designed to manage the sorts of inventories that large conferences need to manage, build up complex tickets with multiple items, and handle payments using whatever payment gateway you happen to have access to

Development of registrasion was commenced by Christopher Neugebauer in 2016, with the gracious support of the Python Software Foundation.
